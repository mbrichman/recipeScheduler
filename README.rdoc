== RecipeScheduler

This is a work in progress personal project to create an application for scheduling the cooking of many recipes at the same time.

Say you are planning a dinner party and you've picked out 4 recipes. What do you do in what order to ensure all the food arrives at the table hot at the same time?

This application is designed to solve that problem.

It is very much work in progress. Feel free to have a look.
